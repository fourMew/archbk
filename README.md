Kernels after 5.10 broke booting on the Samsung Chromebook 2 xe503c12 peach-pit and I think some other 32 bit arm chromebooks. Others noted this issue for the xe303c12 Samsung Chromebooks. Ctrl + U just beeps at you instead of booting your linux partition with newer kernels on these devices.

Quick and dirty fix swapping out the link for the latest version of the rootfs tarball for an archive.org link to an older one with the 5.8.0 kernel (newest one I could easily find, it you find a link for one with a newer version please send it to me)

To install Arch Linux ARM on a SDcard / USB drive:

   ___* Make sure that developer mode is enabled.
   (enabling developer mode will wipe everything on the chromebook's internal flash memory. back up anything you want to keep.)___

     Hold down the ESC and Refresh keys and poke the Power button.
     At the Recovery screen press Ctrl-D 
     (there's no prompt - you have to know to do it).
     
     Confirm switching to developer mode by pressing enter, 
     and the laptop will reboot and reset the system. 
     
     This takes about 15-20 minutes.
     
     Note: After enabling developer mode, 
     you will need to press Ctrl-D each time you boot, 
     or wait 30 seconds to continue booting.
    <br/>

   _the following steps work in chromeOS_

   1) get CROSH shell going (press ctrl + alt + t, then enter `shell`)
   2) `cd ~/Downloads` (moves to your current user's downloads directory)
   3) `curl -LO https://raw.githubusercontent.com/altreact/archbk/master/make-arch_drv.sh`
   4) `sudo sh make-arch_drv.sh`  or `sudo sh make-arch_drv.sh (dev)` (where dev = sda, sdb, mmcblk1, ect)
   5) follow the instructions & let the script do it's thing.
   6) reboot, then press ctrl + u to boot Arch Linux ARM (username: root , password: root)
  
To install Arch Linux ARM to internal flash memory:

   1) [create a chromeos recovery media device](https://goo.gl/FfCQkC)
   2) follow instructions above to install Arch Linux ARM on a SDcard / USB drive.
   3) `sh helper.sh`(allows you to easily: change root password, create new sudo user, connect to wifi, install Arch on internal flash memory)
   4) follow the instructions & let the script do it's thing.
   5) press ctlr + d, then login with your new user credentials.
   
After Installation:

   1) [update your mirrorlist](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/mirrors)
   2) `pacman -Syu` (updates system and all software)
   3) [other post install recommendations](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/General_recommendations)
   4) if you don't fancy the command line interface and want a decent Graphical User Interface (GUI, DE), [install MATE Desktop Environment](https://calvin.me/arch-linux-samsung-arm-chromebook/)
